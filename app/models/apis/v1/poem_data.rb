          text: "Some say the world will end in fire,\n Some say in ice.\n From what I’ve tasted of desire\n
          I hold with those who favor fire.\n But if it had to perish twice,\n I think I know enough of hate\n
          To know that for destruction ice\n Is also great,\n And would suffice."

          title: "Hope",
          author: "Emily Dickinson",
          text: "HOPE is the thing with feathers \n That perches in the soul, \n
          And sings the tune without the words, \n And never stops at all, \n 
          And sweetest in the gale is heard; \n And sore must be the storm \n
          That could abash the little bird \n That kept so many warm. \n
          I’ve heard it in the chillest land, \n And on the strangest sea; \n Yet, never, in extremity, \n
          It asked a crumb of me."
